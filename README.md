This repository contains the Named Entity Disambiguation tool based on DBpedia Spotlight. Providing that a DBpedia Spotlight Rest server for a given language is running, the ixa-pipe-ned module will take KAF or NAF as input (containing elements) and perform Named Entity Disambiguation for your language of choice.
